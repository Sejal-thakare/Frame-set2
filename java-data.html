        <h1>Java history</h1>
    </center>
    Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[23] Java was originally
    designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the
    time.[24] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the
    project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[25]
    Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[26]<br><br>

    Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[27] It promised write once, run
    anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring
    configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the
    ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written
    in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[28] With the advent of Java
    2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for
    different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in
    server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed
    J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.<br><br>

    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize
    Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[29][30][31] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the
    Java Community Process.[32] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite
    their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized
    products such as the Java Enterprise System.<br><br>

    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS),
    under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core
    code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun
    did not hold the copyright.[33]<br><br>

    Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.[34] Following
    Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java
    technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[35] This did not
    prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see
    the Android section).<br><br>

    On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.[36]

    In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser
    plugin.[37]<br><br>

    Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers.[38]

    Principles
    There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:<br><br>

    It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.<br>
    It must be robust and secure.<br>
    It must be architecture-neutral and portable.<br>
    It must execute with high performance.<br>
    It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.<br>

    Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many
    of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:

    Java Card for smart-cards.[43]<br>
    Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments with limited resources.[44]<br>
    Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation environments.[45]<br>
    Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.[46]<br>
    The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of<br>
    related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.<br>

    Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME
    configuration-profile pairings.<br>

    Execution system
    Java JVM and bytecode
    Main articles: Java (software platform) and Java virtual machine
    One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly
    on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling
    the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to
    architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended
    to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java
    Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java
    applets.<br><br>

    Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and
    networking.

    The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine
    instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT)
    compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java's Hotspot
    compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16)
    allowing tiered compilation.[47] Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is
    to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM) for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine
    language.[48]<br><br>

    Performance
    Main article: Java performance
    Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++
    .[49][50] However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time
    compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1,[51] the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such
    as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual
    machine, such as HotSpot becoming Sun's default JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the
    addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock-free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other
    multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.<br><br>

    Non-JVM
    Some platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in
    hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine,[52] and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support
    for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current
    implementations of ARM.<br><br>

    Automatic memory management
    Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when
    objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in
    use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by
    the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference
    to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers
    that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown.[53][54]<br><br>

    One of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of
    having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly
    allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility
    of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs.
    If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined
    and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by
    the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent
    logical memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.<br><br>

    Garbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be
    triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to
    stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.<br><br>

    Java does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g.
    by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures
    type safety and security.<br><br>

    As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are either stored
    directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for
    non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for
    performance reasons.
    <br><br>
    Java contains multiple types of garbage collectors. Since Java 9, HotSpot uses the Garbage First Garbage Collector
    (G1GC) as the default.[55] However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the
    heap. For most applications in Java, G1GC is sufficient. Previously, the Parallel Garbage Collector was used in Java
    8.
    <br><br>
    Having solved the memory management problem does not relieve the programmer of the burden of handling properly other
    kinds of resources, like network or database connections, file handles, etc., especially in the presence of
    exceptions.

    Syntax
    Main article: Java syntax
    <br>
    Dependency graph of the Java Core classes (created with jdeps and Gephi)
    The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured,
    generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[18] All
    code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types,
    (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance
    reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).
    <br><br>
    Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading[56] or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple
    inheritance is supported for interfaces.[57]
    <br><br>
    Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked
    with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style
    opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to
    create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as
    Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.

    Hello world example<br>
    The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:[58]

    public class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
    }
